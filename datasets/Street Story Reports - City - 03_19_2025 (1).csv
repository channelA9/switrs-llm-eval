The cars are speeding up to get on the freeway or speeding off of it. The lighting is also inadequate. The bike lanes are merely painted on and drivers don't pay any attention to them. The worst part is that this is near a busy transit station, which includes light rail, local bus, and buses to San Francisco. It's also the closest light rail station to Sacramento State.

129, night, badly.   It has a 'bike friendly' crossing at MLK Jr way and yet the surface is so BAD i no longer use it.   The city states is bicycle friendly, and yet they let the road surface decay such that they are un rideable, IMHO.
I believe that the biggest factor that people don't ride bikes more is the quality of the road surfaces.   Please tell them.   I've complained many time and got blown off.   You have a bigger megaphone, please use it.

289, night, I drifted into the track, fell down, and scraped my knees. The scrapes took a week to scab over.

290, night, the bike lane is unprotected, in the door zone, with only a tiny strip of paint to separate it from the car traffic. In some areas, such as northbound next to Bethel Lutheran Church, there are significant stretches with no bike lane at all. The speed limit is nominally 35 mph, which is already pretty fast, but the road design encourages people to drive much faster. This is especially alarming when drivers decide to double-park in the bike lane, forcing me into the fast lane. A special highlight is the intersection of Silver and Alemany, where once a car started rolling from Silver onto Alemany when I was crossing Silver, walking in the intersection. Silver also encourages fast driving, and a few years ago a driver killed a pedestrian who was walking his bike in the intersection., San Francisco, CA, 94112, USA,37.7310480003479],[-122.433528999969,37.7297239999149],[-122.435459999639,37.7276200000588],[-122.437520000079,37.7238180000587],[-122.439837000436,37.7199139998498],[-122.445544999956,37.7154670002563],[-122.450223000155,37.7133959997409],[-122.452625999828,37.711630999765],[-122.454472000007,37.7106800000244]]

1.  Flooding at Manzanita in front of Caltrans lot shorts out signal.  CHP refuses to direct traffic saying it's too dangerous for them.
2.  Sidewalk need is critical between Flamingo Road and Shoreline Highway at Tam Junction on south side of road adjacent to Good Earth market.
3.  Traffic signals are poorly timed in this area and can't handle volume of traffic.
4.  Tam Junction 3-way intersection gives red light in all directions if pedestrian pushes walk button.  Stops traffic unnecessarily including eastbound Shoreline traffic turning northbound onto Almonte when pedestrians cross Shoreline from northeast to southwest corner.

Between Herrick and CR,  there are 3 freeway exits: Humboldt Hill, King Salmon, and Fields Landing. Each exit has an off-ramp and on-ramp, for a total of 6 opportunities for car-bike conflicts in 4 miles. Cars are traveling at 60+ mph and are not expecting bikes, are not able/willing to slow down suddenly if a bike is traversing one of these on/off ramps.
I travel this stretch regularly, crossing the 6 ramps. I can count the number of times that were free of car-conflict on one hand. It is harrowing.

Wild Canary is a straightaway so drivers accelerate until the curve at Blackbird, slow somewhat then accelerate again up the hill.  They also speed along the reverse route.

Even if it were cleared it may still only be 1 foot wide total in some areas. One specific section is the road bridges with sidewalks between Felton and Ben Lomond—it’s excellent they are there—the 2nd Northbound bridge has a guardrail blocking bikes from using it so I again am forced into car traffic on a narrow bridge when an alternative was built in and could be utilized. Another section of focus would be a re-painting if the lane lines at Hwy 9 directly north of the Felton empire/graham hill rd intersection to open up space at the hillside reinforcement. A pedestrian was struck and killed here and the solution was to force bikes and pedestrians up a steep neighborhood hill to avoid the road—this is not adequate as it is a pain to use and I still see people walking/bik, bikelane, or full of debris. It would be nice if even a couple times a year street service can pull glass/sharp matter/ overgrown vegetation from the roadside—not just the ground but cut a usable wall away (poison oak, blackberry encroachment some of the most painful, redwood trees saplings/branches also invading bike lanes)., Ben Lomond, CA, 95005, USA,37.129255],[-122.120247,37.115705],[-122.115955,37.113652],[-122.115269,37.109408],[-122.107029,37.10667],[-122.101707,37.100098],[-122.098103,37.098181],[-122.097073,37.092841],[-122.08952,37.088597],[-122.090378,37.084215],[-122.086945,37.08216],[-122.084026,37.079284],[-122.085571,37.07545],[-122.081795,37.069423],[-122.078705,37.060931],[-122.073555,37.054081]]
667, which has a lot of traffic going mostly at 40 mph, but some cars go faster. Three properties, indicated here have no continuous place to walk where a person could stay off the street. One of the properties has so much vegetation that there is virtually no point at which one could step off the street for safety. One of the properties has a County-installed handicap ramp, but only the residents of the property have access to it. Access is blocked for any kind of wheelchair on both the east and west sides of the property. It makes no sense., this block is not that far from the commercial area, Lake Ave, and at least two schools (St. Marks and the Armenian school). These residents are planting pedestrian-blocking shrubs on County right of way. Not fair.

676, ride, night, obstacle, driving-speed, drive to Surf Market and walk to get the mail and go to the farmers' market. I have a problem with the traffic on the side of the road. I have a 4 door coupe, which is low to the ground, so I can't see pulling out of any of the driveways on the west side of the street, because vehicles are constantly parked in these places along the highway. In addition, I have chose NOT to use the south driveway at Surf because of the overgrown vegetation which has added to ability not to see vehicles coming. It is a dangerous parking lot as it is with peds & the BBQ. It shouldn't be a parking lot at all. Cars race through town. We hear them all the time and I don't want to be hit in my car or when I'm walking to do my shopping. My suggestion to Bower and Surf Market is to level the old Dream Catcher building, which was Vail Pharmacy (I used to work there then) and Surf Super before that. If Dave isn't coming back to hi, bikelane, crosswalks, enforcement, etc. It's dangerous for cars and peds. While we already have the 25 MPH speed limit, many people ignore it and I don't feel safe when I'm walking or even pulling out of one of the driveways when I have my vision blocked by vehicles.

990, at Spreckles, it can't be widened without building another lane on the side or above or below the current roadside. This is a major problem for traffic going through Aptos Village, something that wasn't considered when the new Village was planned. Trestles/bridges on both ends of Soquel going through the Village are not something that can be easily fixed.

Drivers often speed despite dangerous nature
No shoulder, broken down vehicles are stopped in the road, danger to cyclists
Risky and illegal overtakes
Abandoned vehicles left on the side of the road (note: no shoulder) create a potentially lethal road obstacle, esp. at night
Some drivers are unable to keep in their lane; pose threat to opposing traffic
Road markings sometimes difficult to see at night, esp. w/ headlight glare
Plants sometimes obstruct road and visibility
Gravel sometimes found
Curves and bridges too tight for large trucks (cause traffic)
Tailgating drivers

Best & most realistic option: Enforce safe driving and lower speeds (current speed limit is fine, but drivers ignore it since there is no enforcement)

Glad the County is finally going to put in sidewalks but Bike lanes are also sorely needed., sidewalk, bikelane, crosswalks, education, enforcement, community, including Somerset, is a community where the avg resident age skews higher than surrounding areas. Decent pedestrian and biking infrastructure benefits not only school/work commuters/students but older residents. Our older neighbors should be able to use sidewalks safely without risk of bicyclists hitting them because cyclists are also riding on the sidewalk out of fear of being struck due to no dedicated bike lane.
It's  also vitally important that the County adequatrly educate motorists, pedestrians and cyclists on any changes in infrastructure. So far Public Works has not educated the community on new road markings, etc., Castro Valley, CA, 94546, USA,37.70123],[-122.085188,37.701872],[-122.074507,37.701799]]

Northbound, a bike lane is present but is placed in a vulnerable place due to opening car doors. Some cars, especially wide pickup trucks and poorly parked cars, take up a significant portion of the bike lane when parked. Drivers from Rosalinda and Sunflower Ln often make right turns in front of cyclists even when the cyclist has right of way.
At the intersection with Apricot way and Sunflower Ln, drivers often do not yield to cyclists even when they have right of way and run the stop sign to rush ahead of the cyclist.

Also, if a curbside car is slowing down, I can't tell if it's for turning or stopping for pedestrian.

Sadly, our older community members cannot walk anywhere either, because there are no sidewalks or bike paths or even wide easements on local roads,  and so we find many of our friends here isolated, unable to engage or participate in the community.
Furthermore, old train tracks run through the center of the community. No trains go down them as the track is broken on either side of town, so all they represent to the community is a hazard and blight al, sidewalk, bikelane, pavement, lighting, signs, crosswalks, benches, community, other, benches, sidewalks, or bikepaths, and few crosswalks - and those that exist are faded and unused as there is no safe place on either side to walk.

At the same time people trying to walk or bike to work/class are subject to these drivers' dangerous behavior. Whether traffic is moving or backed up it is a major obstacle to travel. Also the traffic noise is quite oppressive due to motorcycles and showoff cars, bikelane, other, I really just don't care if there's traffic congestion. Drivers' convenience is not worth costing lives and the vitality of the community. And, yes, I drive too. Turn the freed up space into bus only lanes and/or curb protected bike lanes.

1415 after school
Coleman Road right before the round about at Arlington Road
Kids are cycling after school on Coleman (about 9 of us) towards Ringwood so there is a car (Car #1) driving slowly behind the line of bikes and moves slightly toward to left to pass the bikes.
Car #2 behind Car #1 revs their engine, steps on the accelerator and passes Car #2 on the left side, swerves in front of it (mind you, there are children cycling in the bike lane or next to the line of park cars on Coleman) so any overcompensation of Car #2 could have hit the group of children/cyclists. Car #2 speeds around the roundabout to the 3rd exit onto Arlington. An example of how dangerous drivers can be on Coleman. We are just WAITING for an accident to happen on that road with our children cycling and dangerous/impatient drivers., bikelane, signs, education, enforcement, Menlo Park, CA, 94025, USA,37.461813],[-122.163248,37.46246]]

I yelled at the car and banged the fender and the car stopped - but it caused us to ride into the intersection as the light was turning red in our direction.
Then the car continued to turn right and the truck behind them yelled at us to, not even close to them.
I think the driver of the truck does not understand the green lane markings and the purpose of a bicycle lane ... at all.    ...or that bicyclists do have a right to be on the road., 805 7th St, Eureka, CA, 95501, USA,40.800442],[-124.162406,40.801141]]

If traffic is ever stopped toward the bottom of the hill, or there are obstructions in the westbound lane, drivers could not see until, moving steeply downhill, it was much too late to begin breaking.  This piece of highway has the potential for an enormous pile up of traffic, a chain reaction of rear-ending.  There are also speeders coming up the hill in the passing lane for the eastbound direction who could be involved in a pileup.  The speed limit for this downhill section needs to be lowered, and signs pointing out poor visibility should give warning to drivers well before the danger., Redwood Valley, CA, 95470, USA,39.23926700002114

415, ped, wheelchair, no-yield, unsafe-speed, the light is very short. Around4:30 rush hour and 8:30am, people drive very fast Run the red light,and into the intersection during rush hour leaving And enteringthe university campus.  We had just gotten up to eastbound bus, there was a red light for eastbound traffic in the cross to the north, two cars came around the bus very rapidly and went into the intersection running the red light, and almost hitting us. The other person was walking with a cane and could not see very well, either in our  is a 55 and older and disabled residence. Which makes it even more troubling. I have seen at least 50 instances of people running red lights there and making the turn without regard to pedestrians, even when we are in the crosswalk., Berkeley, CA, 94705, USA,37.86251100026454

418, there is great danger presented by the automobiles traveling west down the hill on Cedar Street. The vehicles tend to look left, not right, due to the stagger in Arch street, so they don’t see the pedestrians or  The bicyclists on the right., Berkeley, CA, 94708, USA,37.879003999664064

420, night, no-yield, driving-speed,  the 33 bus is going up the hill. there is no curb, so  the bus ramp is very steep when getting off.  There is no sidewalk on either side of the street and the side of the road is washed out so that goes down lower than street-level. So once you get down here you  have you come across the street across the crosswalk but people don’t see that as a place for people to walk or use a wheelchair. People are speeding through and don’t stop. The ac bus stop on the other side is dangerous because the road is steep, and the bus ramp is at an angle that people may fall off, Oakland, CA, 94611, USA,37.821337999825204
421, night, the signage, lanes and pillars under the freeway are confusing and feel dangerous. If the lanes can’t be changed the signage should be changed to be less confusing, Sausalito, CA, 94965, USA,37.87160600008398

474, ride, no-yield, driving-speed, cars speed down Colmar Ave. Some cars don't stop at the stop light. It's worse on the weekends. Sometimes cars will do donuts at the intersection. My guess is inebriated drivers use Colmar and Lubec to avoid the major streets. In addition, there is a street light near the corner of Colmar and Lubec that is malfunctioning. It will turn off for long periods of time at night. During this time the street is pitch black.

I pass through this intersection on foot and bicycle daily to take my child to daycare/pick him up, and I literally see someone run the red light on San Pablo every single time.
A complicating factor is that this intersection is right on the Emeryville/Oakland border so each city probably considers it the other city's problem. Plus, San Pablo is a state highway., Emeryville, CA, 94608, USA,37.83711399983525

670, bike, driver reentered lane right next to drivers.  Driver was aggressive. Once the driver passed the cyclists, he slammed on his brakes and came to a dead stop, causing one cyclist to swerve into oncoming traffic and the causing the other cyclist to skid across the road.

I had to swerve into the shoulder - luckily there were no parked cars at that particular location - in order to avoid being hit. Immediately upon my swerving out of the lane, the honking stopped, and the truck sped by. It appeared the driver was honking at me to force my out of the lane and did not intend to slow down, yield, or provide a safe passing distance if I did not move out of the way., Arcata, CA, 95521, USA,40.868512999762714

747, the left turn signal at the W Wabash at Broadway intersection... as I come from Costco on W Wabash, attempting a left turn onto Broadway (it's a yield to oncoming traffic left turn)....  that left turn light is desperately too short.
 I routinely sit through three red lights at that intersection before getting my turn to attempt a left turn. Oncoming traffic is persistent and heavy, which makes achieving the left turn dangerous... accordingly there is a huge backlog of cars waiting to make that turn who sit through light after light.
A similar issue exists at that same intersection when attempting a left turn from Fairfield Street onto W Wabash Avenue. That turn isn't a yield turn, but the turn light is way too brief. It causes people to run a red light.
If I'm siting at that intersection on Fairfield Street waiting to make a left turn onto W Wabash, sitting behind a line of cars that is backed up to W Del Norte Street, I know I won't make, Eureka, CA, 95501, USA,40.791579999785704

804, night, but especially between Blocksburg and Alderpoint, and without any warning signs in many places, the road simply drops to one lane and where the lane should be is a sheer cliff drop-off.

856, Harris is a two-lane, one-way street, and on one side of the intersection, H is a two-lane, one-way street, and on the other side of the intersection, it is a two-lane street. People who are turning left from the left lane on the one-way side of H street onto Harris rarely yield to those turning right from the other side of H onto Harris. What is worse, within one block, Harris goes from two lanes one way to a two-way street. At the intersection of Harris and I Street, those in the left lane are forced to turn left, and those in the right may procede down the newly two-lane street. What that means is that people turning left from Harris onto H often want to go to the right lane, so not only do they not yield, but they come all the way over to the right lane as they turn. There are near misses all the time when I am turning right from H onto Harris in the morning. A sign saying left turn must yield would help, as would a controlled left turn arrow as part of the li, Eureka, CA, 95503, USA,40.78034600017517

935, waiting to make a left turn. I was driving and did not realize there was the possibility of a left turn onto Big Lagoon Road - it's a 4 lane highway. Luckily, the driver turned left in time for me to avoid rear-ending the car, but it really rattled me because of how terrible a crash it could have been, likely fatal., Trinidad, CA, 95570, USA,41.15603399993343

There are bus stops (without any lighting) on both sides of this road and the nearest crosswalk is .5 mile away.   This means that families and individuals have to wait for a break in the traffic and run across.  We have a Summer Athletic Camp on the south side of this road, and the Police Chief has offered to come out to stop the traffic for the kids (8-18 years old) that are coming to the camp from the Mobile Home  Park across the street.  For another camp we got off at the bus stop yesterday and 30 kids and 3 leaders had to run across the road to make it across for the walk to their field trip location.  A large subsidized housing and condo complex (>150 residents), a bus barn for the local elementary and high schools, several heavy industries (e.g., gravel and logging businesses), and a mobile home park (>200 mobile homes) all exit to Giuntoli Lane near the point I placed on the map,;";";";";";";";";, Arcata, CA, 95521, USA,40.904877000127065

977, bike, night, no-yield, driving-speed, particularly people turning right, looks for cyclists or pedestrians.  The traffic signal won't allow pedestrians to cross while the railroad crossing gates are down, even though there is no danger to pedestrians or cyclists in allowing them to cross while the gates are down.  This causes some pedestrians and cyclists to cross against the signal so that they don't miss the train.  Additionally, the signal is poorly timed and seems more concerned with moving vehicle traffic at the expense of pedestrians and cyclists., Sacramento, CA, 95823, USA,38.462459000109455

This route is used by a large number of students traveling to Menlo Atherton High School.  There is no stop sign on Van Buren,  but there is on Ringwood which is now carries more traffic.  Many bike riders especially students fail to stop or even look when crossing Van Buren. Since the road is parallel to the path a person on a bike must look almost directly behind to see southbound traffic on Van Buren.  A stop sign should be added to Van Buren to reduce the hazard now that traffic patterns have shifted and the potential for severe or fatal injuries in a collision with high speed vehicles on Van Buren., Menlo Park, CA, 94025, USA,37.47471499980198

She suffered a severe concussion, broken wrist and abrasions to her left side. Police report says the 14 year old is at fault because she didn't stop at the traffic light, but if you watch this intersection, no one stops there.

Bicycles and pedestrians are expected to use the same narrow section of sidewalk and crosswalks; there is no bike lane.  In addition, the city has a chronic housing shortage, and this place being confusing and little-used makes it popular as a place to camp. The camping reduces the usefulness of the sidewalk even more. For all its progressive talk, the city hates actual homeless people, so somebody erected fences and obstacles to keep the homeless people off the dirt patches under the freeway, forcing them onto the sidewalk.

The other driving cuts across all 3 lanes, cutting across that solid line and almost caused an accident as they have just cut in front of me. I have had to slam on my breaks to avoid hitting people who do this.

1184, poor-sign, curving, no-yield, almost striking me in the crosswalk.  He called me a derogatory name before speeding off.  The driver coming behind him stopped to ask whether I was OK.  Sight lines between drivers and pedestrians at this location are blocked by a hedge on the west side of Casitas.  Furthermore, drivers often look left for other vehicles as they steer to the right.  As a result, they miss pedestrians coming from their right.  Additionally, the sidewalk on the west side of Casitas is partly blocked by rocks and a telephone pole, and the crosswalk markings are worn and faded.  I've had several previous near-misses at this location., Altadena, CA, 91001, USA,34.193131000034086

1191, bike, scooter, ride, night, poor-bikelane, poor-street, poor-lighting, no-yield, driving-speed, the road is in terrible condition and cars travel at a very high rate of speed. There is not a posted speed limit sign anywhere on the road, which is very concerning.  It is shocking to me that a path of travel this close to an elementary school could be allowed to be in this condition. This is a concern for the safety of the children that attend South Bay School., Eureka, CA, 95503, USA,40.73833199997146

1198, night, driving-speed, this is where the should narrows to almost nothing. It’s frightening. I would like to see an adequate shoulder between the Mad River Slough and Jackson Ranch Road. Please note that when you get to Jackson Ranch Road, you have an alternative route to Arcata away from traffic., Arcata, CA, 95521, USA,40.86550500032678
1199, bike,  at the intersection of Janes Road and Ernest Way there is a crosswalk.  Cars are consistently parked in the bike lane, which causes cyclist to have to merge into the vehicle lane.  Also when cars are parked here, we cannot safely view the oncoming northbound traffic to use the crosswalk safely, we must walk out into the bike lane in order to see beyond the cars.  Sometimes oncoming vehicles making a right hand turn will quickly merge into the bike lane where the cross walk is prior to making their turn, and can easily not see pedestrians there straining to see around the parked cars.  At this intersections, pedestrians, which include people living in the neighborhood, children attending the school down the road, and people accessing the hospital must wait for long periods of time before people stop their cars and allow pedestrians to cross., Arcata, CA, 95521, USA,40.89783700000156
1200, night, Janes Road was resurfaced and re painted.  After this was done, a section of the bicycle lane was not painted back on.  This makes it very unclear to drivers traveling northbound on this road, to drivers parking alongside the school or pulling into the school parking lot., Arcata, CA, 95521, USA,40.89484900001264
1201, unsafe-speed, posted as 25 mph.  There are bike lanes on both sides, and the northbound side also has a sidewalk.  This road is a main route, connecting services, neighborhoods, hospitals, fire station.  Drivers of  vehicles traveling northbound consistently manage the inertia of speeding/not reducing speed, by cutting the corner, which means cutting into the bike lane.  On multiple occasions been nearly run off the road.

Traffic was very heavy.  As a driver, I received several honks and gestures from other drivers, even though I made safe stops at these crosswalks.  It felt like everyone on this street didn't want to be interrupted by pedestrians.  I recommend that these cross walks include flashing lights to notify drivers of their intention to cross and to notify drivers that they must prepare to stop., Eureka, CA, 95501, USA,40.7897100002795

Motorists are going way too fast down Mount Hermon and there is insufficient signing and pavement markings for bicyclists.  There should be a dashed green lane through the  right-turn conflict point for northbound bicyclists, paired with signage telling motorists to yield to bicyclists.

Some factors:
- Bluebonnet goes uphill to Bean Creek (poor visibility)
- there is only a stop sign for Bluebonnet aernd the condos across the street
- there is no sidewalk on the top south side of Bluebonnet
- there is overgrowth on Bean Creek when you are trying look for oncoming traffic
- the positioning of the crosswalk is set far back from oncoming traffic, so makes for a very rough merge or to see if there is oncoming traffic
- this is somewhat of a cut through for people, so speed is a concern

Recently, the pedestrian signal has been modified for crossing San Pablo Avenue, but there seems to be little or no benefit to the pedestrians.  Crossing at this corner is very dangerous to pedestrians.

1340, pulled out and followed me (at slow speed) along J street with his window rolled down, telling me he had cameras on his car and could prove he'd done nothing wrong. He then started taking photos of me with his cell phone camera.
Root cause is driver aggression. There are bike lanes on J street and he had to pass me to cut me off in the first place, so he did it consciously. Since he ultimately did not end up parking but drove away instead, it was all probably a set-up to bully a cyclist., Eureka, CA, 95501, USA,40.79319199988437

1371, obstacle, unsafe-speed, the lines on the road made it look like a 4 way stop. There was no sign other than a stop sign. Cars were parked on all curbs, so when I waited for a pedestrian to cross, I looked both ways and entered the intersection. I couldn't see oncoming traffic, so I inched out a bit to look, and at this point I was inched out so far and I could finally see the traffic coming. Within seconds a car sped up into me and T boned my car. It was found to be my fault because the other vehicle had the right of way. I made multiple precautions, and I had no choice but to inch out and take a chance that no cars were coming. This happens on all 2 way stops in Eureka. The vehicle that hit me could have avoided the accident if they weren't speeding because the speed limit was 25 MPH and they were driving about 45 MPH., Eureka, CA, 95501, USA,40.801098999674295

The guy was fine and my car was totaled and I broke my neck. I was lucky I didn't die. It was said to be my fault because the truck had the right of way, even though he was going about 50 MPH down a curved hill with overgrown vegetation. This happens all the time in this intersection. I was just unlucky that it was an actual accident. Later I discovered that while in the same exact location, the right frame of the windshield causes a blind spot to the top of the hill. Fixing the vehicle is not what needs to be solved. People need to stop speeding down this curved hill where there is a ton of traffic., Eureka, CA, 95501, USA,40.80302999985553

1392, night,  the signal box for the lighted signal is located in a retaining wall. It would be nearly impossible for a person in a wheelchair to reach and it is not in a good position for a person who is blind to find.  It is also a poor location for a person who is blind to find while lining up to cross safely. They would have to take several steps to get to the curb to listen to traffic to line up correctly. Once there, if they decide to wait for another series they have to back up several steps to find the signal box again and then try to line up all over again. This is definitely and unsafe placement.

A driver exiting the parking lot did not look in my direction (the, after all--riders approach those vehicles from the right) and drove nearly into the bike lane, in order to  gauge the very heavy traffic.  A west-bound driver on the road, who apparently did not notice me heading toward him & across the path of the exiting driver, stopped and waved the exiting driver into the traffic; so the exiting driver continued across the trail and into the road.  Only because I saw that the exiting driver never looked my way was I able to avoid a collision by riding around the rear of his car, as he crossed in front of me. I experience this kind of near-miss nearly every time I ride that part of the West County Trail, in either direction.

1549, ride, night, but especially to the section from Hwy 116 (Jenner) to the Mendocino County line. With few short exceptions, there is no shoulder on this road. Lanes seem narrower than on most state highways. The road twists and turns, limiting site lines. To pass a bicycle on this narrow road, you MUST swing about half-way into the opposing lane. If there is a blind turn ahead, you simply have to slow to the speed of the cyclist. Drivers are becoming evermore impatient and are frequently passing cyclists just ahead of a blind turn in the road. It is only a matter of time before we have tragic head-on vehicle collisions. This road is unsafe for both motorists and cyclists. It desperately needs adequate cycling lanes for both directions of travel (perhaps a two-way cycling line on one side of the road.), Jenner, CA, 95450, USA,38.60382799983777

1561, bike, August 23, as I rode my bike through the intersection northbound after the traffic light turned green, I was hit by a car from behind. The car that hit me did not stop. I landed on the curb and the fall broke my left hand in a couple of places and more severely, the top of my right humerus bone cracked all the way through giving me a broken shoulder. Though marked to, the road narrows and splits there, causing drivers to veer right slightly. Perhaps the driver that hit me overcompensated for the split, perhaps they weren't paying attention. I was wearing bright colors and had flashing lights front and back on my bike. It was approximately 8:30AM, bright and sunny.

I had bruising on my leg and my bike required $250 of repairs due to the resulting fall.  I'm lucky he didn't just straight up run me over!
The police who came basically told me I was at fault, since I was not supposed to be riding in the street / taking the lane in the first place (according to them).
The city has discussed plans to put sharrows on this road.  I don't know how that would have helped in this situation, nor whether the police would change their mind over some paint in the road.  There was a lot of, Alameda, CA, 94501, USA,37.76757299990859

* It is very narrow.  A bicycle crash will almost certainly involve entanglement with the railing.  In the worst case, it could involve being thrown into traffic and being run over.
* Passing other people is difficult or impossible due to the narrow width.
* The 5 mph speed limit is rarely followed by bicyclists.  If I wanted to go 4 or 5 mph, I would walk, not take a bike.  Due to the length of the tunnel, nobody really goes 5 mph.
* The confined space traps poisonous exhaust gasses.
* The tunnel is extremely loud inside, and therefore a hazard for the long-term hearing of bicyclists and pedestrians.
* Walls are covered with a thick layer of soot, which is carcinogenic and just plain disgusting to get on clothes.
This is the only off-island connection for bike/ped on the west end of the island.  It is an embarrassment to the city and region.  A proper bike/ped bridge is badly needed here., Alameda, CA, 94501, USA,37.791159000008626

A coworker was visiting a friend in Alameda and was unfamiliar with the area.  He rides a, the same incident could have happened with a bike or scooter as well.
Anyhow, he was leaving Alameda on Webster Street and he missed the initial, and was forced to ride through the tunnel with traffic (who were angry at him).  He was so freaked out and worried he might be caught on camera and deported out of the country. (he is here on a work visa)

1580, obstacle, so I got impatient and tried to pass one on the left.  Big mistake.  I wasn't paying attention and got my tire trapped in the rail used by the street cars.  The tire got thoroughly wedged and the bicycle complete stopped abruptly.  I was thrown off my bike.
My shoulder was badly bruised or worse, I had lots of cuts and scrapes, and my finger was very swollen and in pain.  My shoulder eventually recovered, but my finger still doesn't have the same range of motion it used to.  The urgent care said there was no fracture, but I'm not sure I believe them in the case of my finger.
Since this was obviously my own fault for getting my wheel stuck in the tracks, and I was passing a bus on the left by entering a, I did not stick around and wait for police.

In order to not ride in the door zone, I pretty much have to ride in the street.

1583, night, for bicyclists riding on the street e.g. on Otis Dr or Bayview Dr, it's extremely non-obvious where one should exit the street and switch over to the bike/ped bridge if one wishes to do so.
There needs to be clear signage and pathway leading to the bridge that is clearly marked, EXIT HERE --->, but it's really not very obvious/clear.
I found a way to do it by riding on sidewalk on Bayview Dr, then taking another narrow sidewalk to the shoreline, then riding shoreline sidewalk, then riding some gravel in the park that connects to the main bike/ped pathway.  This allows me to avoid riding my bike on busy Otis Drive, where I have been harassed for driving even the brief few hundred feet to exit off that road again.  But the pathway is all very non-obvious., Alameda, CA, 94501, USA,37.75165899986643

I don’t feel safe riding a bicycle on any of the streets and highways in Sonoma County.  There are multiple reasons why they are unsafe.
1.  Vegetation over hanging in the bike paths, forcing cyclists into the roadway.
2.  Debris in the bike paths, i.e., gravel, branches, broken glass, rocks, mud, nails, etc, forcing cyclists into the roadway or having to change a flat tire, as a result of a puncture from the debris.
3.  Pot holes on streets, highways and bicycle paths, forcing the cyclists to maneuver around the obstacles and on coming vehicles.
4. The electrical sensors that trigger the traffic lights to turn green are not sensitive enough to pick up a bicycle, forcing the cyclist to make turns illegally or get off the bike and walk across the pedestrian walkway.
Many of these problems could be significantly reduced with monthly highway and street (i.e., Including the shoulders and bike paths) sweeping and vegetation clearance.

It's extremely unsafe.  Lights or a round-about would help immensely.

When the roadway is raised, the new roadway should be constructed in reinforced concrete as the heavy bus traffic ripples any new asphalt within one year after paving is done. At the time the dikes are installed, the entire affected area of the parking lot should be raised (with a reinforced concrete bus lane) to allow parking, Highway 1, Mill Valley, CA, 94941, USA,37.88031000004471

Whether or not the overall design/layout can be improved, this stretch of sidewalk still badly needs maintenance. County Roads removed some debris and overgrowth last year when I complained. Sidewalk is cracked and  sagging at either side of the overpass where subsidence has occurred just outside the bridge span. Trash and debris accumulates. ADA ramps are cracked and full of water and weeds. Tactile paving is lifting up in at least one spot. There is a flange on the sidewalk where a light post has been sheared off.

1872, bike, ride, driving-speed, other, the drivers leaving the ferry terminal consistently block the intersection so that people trying to leave Larkspur Landing can't get out. Now the traffic light also prevents a right hand turn on red for the off-chance that someone heading into Larkspur Landing might do a u-turn...which is one out of every 30 cars at most! At the same time, people are crossing the street all over the place, and not just at the crosswalk. It's an absolute cluster-f$%! from about 4:00 pm - 7:00 pm every weekday. Changing the order of the traffic lights, so that the ferry terminal light turns green AFTER the Larkspur Landing light turns green would be helpful.

1929, night, before the bridge over Freshwater Creek, the pavement is uneven for 50 feet+, approaching 3 Corners. This is due to a county pavement patch job in the summer of 2018, where new pavement was applied just to the lane and not the shoulder where  bikes travel. The repair created an uneven lip of pavement, and left a rough, unpatched shoulder. The lip further degraded over time and an entire chunk broke off in 2019, leaving a more severe gap in pavement heights between lane and NB shoulder.
Unfortunately, this seems to be a standard practice.  Another example from the same era can be seen on Herrick Rd in Eureka, on the Pine Hill side of the Eureka Golf Course. Like Old Arcata Road, that street is a formal bike route.

1932, Sequoia high school students are crossing. Since this is the exit point for buses from the bus terminal it's ridiculous that they have to make  breakaway left turns south on El Camino, and drivers turning north from James onto El Camino have too much to cope with, with both car and bus traffic emerging from James.

The driveway the driver wanted to enter was initially blocked by other cars while our light was red then she started making the turn when our light turned green & she had the opening. It appeared to me that the cyclist was obscured by the cars, so she didn't see him as she made her way into the driveway. He struck the front right side of her car & went over the hood.

1976, night, on H, trying to turn left onto Samoa boulevard (going west), the traffic light sensor does not pick you up, and the light never turns green for you (until a car also pulls up to make the same maneuver). It leaves the bicyclist no options except to cross while red, or to get off your bike, haul it onto the sidewalk, push the pedestrian button, which still does not turn the light green for your side of the intersection. Instead, it lets you cross as a pedestrian, into oncoming traffic, and you're still on the east side of the intersection.
It's partially messed up because at this intersection, H Street changes from a two way street to a one way street. Please fix, this is a very hazardous and frustrating situation for the people living on the south end of H Street.

I didn't file a police report because I seemed physically fine (outside of some eventual bruising), and I'm aware that this is less this one man's fault, and more of a systemic/endemic issue. Also, he was an immigrant trying to get permanent papers, and given I didn't expect to file a medical claim, calling the police may have created more issues for him. I asked for compensation to fix my back wheel, which was totally busted; I only did this because I'm familiar with bike repairs and thought I could approximate an accurate purchase/labor/install price ($200)., San Francisco, CA, 94103, USA,37.782675

He, she stopped, put down the drivers window asking why.  He commented on the aggressive actions of the vehicle driver.  I rolled up to the open window and told the woman she was the aggressive one.  The last thing she said to me was, a boy had opended the passenger door, she started to drive away with the car door open.

This leads to poor drivers continually not yielding and blowing past the intersection altogether. The intersection is a major thoroughfare for college kids walking to campus, and I have personally almost been hit more than a handful of times and I have witnessed far too many other people and bikes and cars get hit here. Cars always enter the intersection without yielding to pedestrians, and instead of waiting, literally pull into the middle of the intersection, slam on their brakes, and block the whole intersection until the pedestrians pass. This is a highly dangerous intersection, I walk past it everyday and almost everday witness drivers doing something stupid or almost crashing as a result of this intersections design., Arcata, CA, 95521, USA,40.878794

2040, it is very hazardous to make a  right hand turn ON RED (northbound) onto Marengo Avenue, because of MULTIPLE visibility issues.  There are many bushes right at the curb on the Southeast corner of this intersection, obscuring visibility for westbound traffic on Altadena Drive, when looking left (southbound) onto Marengo Avenue.   Additionally, the southern segment of Marengo at this intersection joins at a bit of a, not at a typical 90 degree intersection, with Altadena Drive.  Uphill traffic on Marengo Ave also tends to, to, from westbound Altadena Drive to northbound Marengo Avenue, EXTREMELY hazardous.

He blamed his driving lapse on my grey outfit and asked why I wasn't wearing fluorescent colors to make myself visible. I pointed to the fluorescent yellow jacket rolled up and strapped to my rear bag- visible from 3 sides- as well as the large yellow reflective bands facing backwards. He shook his head and said he couldn't see them and persisted in his view that I was not adequately equipped.
When I told him Westhaven Drive is a Bike Route and living nearby he probably should know to expect cyclists on the road, and he's responsible for avoiding crashes where someone could be maimed or killed, he threw up his hands and got back in his SUV.

It's very difficult for bikers to take a left off Buena Vista onto east cliff or to get to the trestle Bridge. At night signage along the crosswalk actually blocks visibility for cars and makes it more dangerous.
I'd suggest the following:
 Extending the cement median to run closer to the crosswalk to prevent illegal lefts onto Eadt Cliff.
 Using a raised table crosswalk to force vehicles to slow even when people aren't present.
Stop sign at east cliff and Murray so cars have less incentive to speed around the corner and to support left turns from Murray to East Cliff

Cars often pass right next to me, with mirrors about to touch me, because they cannot go in the other lane.  There is no way to solve this without either a bike lane, or an alternative route (such as making a bike lane down the railroad tracks).  Having people ride Graham Hill Road is not a viable option (I don't feel safe their either).,  Graham Hill Road, or the railroad tracks.  I think the cheapest and easiest would be to pave between the railroad tracks, and let bikers use that.  Sure, trains occasionally use the tracks, but they are going extremely slow (slower than bikers would be) and it would be very easy for bikers to get off when a train approaches.  Or a path directly to the side of the tracks could be paved, but this would still necessitate bikers getting out of the way when trains approach., Felton, CA, 95018, USA,37.041043
2456, unsafe-speed, the bus actually crossed into the bike lane, though there was nobody there so nobody got hurt. I think the issue was the bus couldn't really see far enough in front to track bicycles given the speed it was travelling, plus the bike lane is pretty narrow, leading to a very close call. I believe the solution is to widen the bike lane to give more margin for error, at minimum in the part of this road where visibility is naturally limited.

Having been physically hit by a car many years ago, I am hyper-vigilant when crossing any street, and it got to the point where I'd walk up the street and cross at the signal, rather than take my chances at the crosswalk.

Most cars fo not follow those speed limits, on the small straight of way in front of my home, they speed by at 50 or more mph.  It was once a little country road but with the newer residents and workmen don't seem to want to slow down for any reason... I suggest speed bumps on the straight and more speed limit signs.  I am not the only neighbor who feels this way.  We were once all able to walk, push strollers, ride ponies with NO WORRY... this little country road that is even marked 1 lane in some areas is now a speedway... very dangerous to walk or even go to the road to check my mailbox...

Hi Jan,
I appreciate the research you did.  Yet, research by a vendor selling the product isn’t very compelling.  Studies I have seen and what I have heard from traffic experts is that radar signs are not very effective, especially over time.  Clearly enforcement is the issue, if people are breaking the law.  That said I am certain there are not enough resources to enforce all of the laws all of the time.  We are in the process of gathering traffic date on Soquel Drive and will then be looking at the entire corridor for safety and congestion.  We anticipate the data collection will take some time.  Hopefully in the coming year we can devote resources to conduct traffic counts and gather all roadway data.
Thank you for your patience.

No other traffic and plenty of room on the road for both of us even in this residential ‘hood with on street parking., education, community, Arcata, CA, 95521, USA,40.86081
2649, broken elbow and minor scrapes and bruises. I lost 2 hours of my memory but after examining the area where I was found, there was a big pothole which is notorious on Raymond Hts. I had complained weeks earlier to the city about the horrible potholes and the city paved various areas of the street except for the one area I crashed.  Raymond Hts continues to be one of the worst rated streets in the City scoring 10 out street scale 1 to 100 where 1 is worst and 100 is best. City won't fix street bec needs total reconstruction., uneven, and cracked pavment is desperately needed. Individual pothole repairs made by the city are poorly patched, deteriorate quickly, and leave large hunks of rubble that is very unsafe for bikers or walkers. There is also a small park at the top of the hill that is also deteriorating with cracked retaining walls that the city does not maintain. The oldest neighbor living on the street for over 80 years has never seen the city pave the road. Excuses of not having funds to reconstruct the street very unfair considering the years of taxes all the residents have paid for all of those 80 years. The city maintains streets that are in much better condition because they can cover with a slurry vs fixing the worst roads like Raymond Heights that needs total reconstruction.

2745, night, driving-speed, the east side of Park Ave is the only side with a sidewalk. When walking south across the northwest offramp there is dangerously low visibility due to low tree branches. Drivers exiting are looking left (Cabrillo students, Aptos residents, etc.) but not looking at pedestrians on the right.  The big problem is that pedestrian can't see through the low branches to know if there is an incoming car. This is a scary situation but its the only way I can cross to get my two young children to school. I submitted a county hazard report in 2016 that resulted in Caltrans vegetation removal but Caltrais didn't remove the low branches and they did not improve the visibility.  For reference here is a new pedestrian report in San Francisco that discusses similar pedestrian hazards at highway offramps where buildings (instead of vegetation) lead to dangerous visibility for pedestrians.

Sidewalk is too narrow to accommodate walkers, runners and cyclists. Two-way single lane road is too narrow to accommodate cars and cyclists. Since West Cliff Drive is not a road utilized for vehicle thru traffic or public transportation (utilized only for residential traffic and recreational traffic), recommend conversion to one-way single-lane vehicle traffic with a pedestrian-only area where the current sidewalk is located and a separate two-way bicycle only area. As part of the overall redesign, would also recommend moving parking areas from the sidewalk area--where they are currently located--to a new area adjacent to the single lane vehicle traffic area., Santa Cruz, CA, 95060, USA,36.949876

Drivers are frustrated and often gun it once they get their turn since it is so backed up and busy in the mornings during many people's commute., there need to be more access roads in and out of Cutten. It's crazy to funnel all of that traffic through just 2 streets.

Drivers are aggressive here because they don't want to get caught at the red light, which often holds drivers for long periods of time, even when there is no cross traffic. When crossing with a WALK signal, drivers often do not yield to me in the crosswalk. They are either distracted or looking the other way for traffic as they turn right or left.

Bicyclists must share the lanes with drivers., education, enforcement, and limit the height to no more than 3 FT at the corners for 25-30 FT minimum (the more the better). The traffic signals need to be more responsive to traffic so drivers do not get anxious about getting through before it turns red.

Drivers need to be educated about yielding to pedestrians while they are turning at signals. Traffic laws need to be enforced.

As a cyclist, I have had similar problems myself and often wave stopped vehicles on because others do not stop and it's too dangerous to risk it. However there are no nearby traffic lights and it's a long way for pedestrians to go to get to one, so you often see people running across the road here dodging traffic. In the last two months, improvements have been made with an advanced curb that allows pedestrians to see better past parked vehicles if they are not very large.

Did not stop for clearly-marked stop sign at Cordova.
Drivers westbound on Cordova had to stand on their brakes to avoid broadsiding the BMW..
Cyclist (I) was traveling eastbound on Cordova in the bike lane and had traveled to the left-turn land to turn left and go north on MIchigan.
If I had been a faster cyclist, I would have been struck by the speeding BMW.
Since there had been a fatality of a speeding BMW running a stop sign a few blocks from there, I have to watch to see if cars stop at stop lights and stop signs at all.
If I had been about one or two seconds to the turn northbound on Michigan, I would have been the center of a car sandwich between the speeding BMW )southbound on Michigan) and the cars traveling eastbound on Cordova.
A woman died recently (11/26) just a few blocks from where this occurred.
Sadly, this is not unusual.
This occurred:at 2 pm in full daylight.
There is a park directly across the street whe, bikelane, crosswalks, enforcement, community, selfish drivers won't abide by posted speed limits.
Drivers who, cyclists, dog-walkers, ladies pushing strollers and other vehicles as obstacles to speed around.

Street design encourages speeding.
Where else do you have two lanes,side-by-side, a straightaway and a light indicating it's time to stomp on the gas pedal?
Sound like a racetrack?
People exit the freeway and treat surface streets like freeways, too -- because they're designed to for speed.
Street design for the speed injures people inside and outside of cars.
Motorists need to have dash cams because once they are hit, the other driver that is speeding will lie.
Maybe if pedestrians and cyclists started wearing bodycams and posting dangerous drivers, city officials won't wait until more people die to alter street design.
It's very difficult to counter car culture.
Rude, aggressive drivers ignore stop sign + speed limit signs..
Thanks!

I am on the Northwest corner of Colorado and Berkeley on the sidewalk waiting for the walk signal to cross southbound on Colorado.
My bike is fully lit: Bright flashing headlamp, red-and-green lights encircling both wheels, flashing red helmet light, and a Christmas wreath with white lights.
Westbound Colorado traffic gets the red light and I get a walk signal to cross in the crosswalk.
One of those westbound Colorado vehicles is not slowing down.
Even though I have the walk signal to cross Colorado, I wait a moment to see that car will stop and it does not.
A small, dark car speeds by, cuts very close to the sidewalk where I am about to cross in the crosswalk, apparently creating its own right-turn lane, and goes full speed northbound on Berkeley.
That car blew through a red light .
If I had actually stepped into the crosswalk with the walk signal, I would not be here typing this.

Scofflaws have zero consequences to their behavior that endangers themselves and other innocent victims.
Why doesn't the DMV start pulling licenses>
Why not have red light cameras that nail red-light runners?
Why not have PROTECTED bike lanes so people can get out of the rat race of driving if they feel like exercising instead of sitting frustrated in traffic.

Just as I (EB) and the WB vehicle were about to cross Allen, an SUV headed NORTH on Allen blew through the stop sign, nearly missing me and the  EB vehicle.

The motorcyclist was forced to swerve off the freeway to avoid a collision. The offending vehicle came within one foot of the motorcyclist, who nearly collided with the protruding mirror. Due to the sudden maneuver and unfavorable conditions off of a traveling lane (debris, low traction, rough road, parallel grooves, cracks & ledges, change of pavement material), the motorcycle experienced a dangerous and violent front wheel oscillation which the rider was barely able to recover from. The motorcyclist rejoined the freeway after recovering from the oscillation., and signaled well in advance. It also would have helped if the driver changed lanes normally instead of rapidly swerving into a lane. Since the freeway is straight and level, the approaching motorcyclist would have been visible for an excess of 30 seconds, indicating that the driver lacks situational awareness., Walnut Creek, CA, 94596, USA,37.908273

This was likely an intentional attack on the motorcyclist despite no prior interaction between the driver and rider, which is evidenced by the offending driver appearing visibly angry, yelling, and gesticulating at the motorcyclist., but may have actually been to lure the motorcyclist into it before intentionally causing a crash.

Drivers turn left from Silver Spur onto Sugar Hill Way going the opposite direction on the roundabout without knowing if there is approaching traffic on Sugar Hill Way, which could lead to head on collisions or collisions with bikes & pedestrians that aren't expecting wrong-way traffic.
Drivers going through the intersection straight through on Silver Spur do not sufficiently slow down to become visible to stopped traffic on Sugar Hill Way, often continuing at over the speed limit
Drivers heading south on Silver Spur often do not stop for northbound drivers turning left onto Sugar Hill Way, enforcement, other
Speed bumps on Silver Spur lane may help slow traffic down before the roundabout and reduce traffic to Freedom High School.
Enlarging the roundabout and forcing all roads to yield to whoever is in the intersection may discourage speeders and right of way violations.
Changing the intersection to an all way stop with a speed table may help.

There have been many many near-miss accidents every day and two very serious accidents in the area just north of Antilles Way on Paradise Drive. A guard rail was put up but it was added TO THE WRONG LOCATION — the guard rail needs to be EXTENDED further north. There are many NEAR-MISSES in this area and a very serious NEAR-FATAL accident happened a few years ago - a CAR WENT OVER THE CLIFF with a driver and passenger severely injured. And, a SCHOOL BUS WENT PARTIALLY OVER THE CLIFF a few years ago and the children and driver had to be rescued.
We have been trying to communicate the severity of this situation for many years now. The guard rail needs to be extended before one of the near-misses that happen daily becomes fatal.
I am a parent and worry about our community. Please help us feel safe.

The situation is waiting for someone to be killed or injured. The city does nothing. Requests to repeat the speed limit, repaint the double yellow line, and installing traffic calming measures are repeatedly ignored.  At least four households on Pratt are furious about the situation with speeding that has gone on for 30 years or more. The roadway is full of potholes that are a hazard to both bicyclists and motorists. There are no sidewalks, so pedestrians and bikers and dog walkers have to mix in with the speeding traffic., pavement, enforcement, AND install traffic calming measures that limit practical speeds to 25 miles an hour.
A signal or some kind of traffic control at the intersection of Pratt and Main Street would certainly improve the safety of that intersection which now has poor visibility of vehicles on Main Street moving at 25 to 35 miles an hour when crossing from Pratt.  But, it'll never happen. Making a left turn from Pratt onto Main you're taking your life in your hands because you have five seconds from the time a southbound vehicle is visible in the Tree Tunnel to when it's in the intersection., Saint Helena, CA, 94574, USA,38.514714

4214, night, California Street, crosses a moderately busy street (Cedar) with one lane of traffic in each direction. Drivers on Cedar frequently roll through the intersection without coming to a complete stop. As a pedestrian, it feels unsafe to cross here unless I've made eye contact with any drivers at or approaching the corner as they cannot be trusted to stop. Though traffic is much lighter at night, the danger doesn't vanish as some drivers barely slow down as the proceed through the stop signs. Not sure what the fix is here -- it's much the same story you could find at any number of four-way stops here in Berkeley., crosswalks, education, enforcement, 1601 California St, Berkeley, CA, 94703, USA,37.876834

4237, I have never felt safe leaving my house. I cannot drive because of my disability and moving here has totally eliminated my ability to go on walks alone. I am in a wheelchair and if it was not for my attendants I would be dead. The cars are too fast and I am too short so often these big cars just don't see me. Frequently I am affected by road rage because my wheelchair takes too long to cross the road, and more than once I have been verbally assaulted by drivers who have no issue telling me so.
The grading on the sidewalks are too steep and the sidewalks are very narrow too. Especially on McKinleyville Ave. I am terrified my wheelchair will fall off the sidewalk. Right outside the highschool, next to the bus stop, there is a telephone pole centered in the sidewalk. I literally have no way to use the sidewalk, when I get off the bus I must be in the bike lane. The bike lane is one of the many too small and I am inches away from cars., sidewalk, bikelane, pavement, lighting, signs, crosswalks, benches, education, enforcement, community, Mckinleyville, CA, 95519, USA,40.956668

4259, I was always nervous to cross 65 in any capacity. I believe, even more now, as a parent with kids and nieces/nephews, myself, that 65 should no longer be the, and that we should move the Highway out to Spruce. We would get less High speed traffic going through our town, over half of the traffic on 65 never even stops in our town. I have been narrowly missed by semi's on many occasions -in vehicles, walking and on bikes, people do not stop for pedestrians - even WITH lights and signs and newer road markings. I think all around EUHS - even ON 65, we should have wide, single or double speed bumps to slow commuters down. I also think a 3rd and 4th TRAFFIC LIGHT would be a great idea at Firebaugh+65 and 65+Sequoia Dr, as pedestrians and drivers have been hit at both areas due to people speeding into town., sidewalk, bikelane, lighting, signs, crosswalks, benches, education, enforcement, Exeter, CA, 93221, USA,36.298059

4292, night, it's very common for vehicles behind the turning vehicle to pass on the right and go around the turning vehicle.  Although it is illegal to do so, this happens all the time all along HWY 65 as ot extends through the City of Exeter.  I know of two major pedestrian injuries (vehicle vs. pedestrian as a result of said vehicle passing a turning vehicle and striking a pedestrian in the crosswalk.
Is is possible to post traffic signs along HWY 65 indicating/identifying a, or something similar, inside city limits?

 Drivers do not pay attention to the crosswalks, even though the crosswalks are equipped with flashing lights. I have multiple times experienced other drivers passing on the right when traffic is stopped to let kids cross, I believe this is because they assume that traffic is stopped for cars to turn left, ignoring the possibility that kids may be in the crosswalk. This happens at the crosswalk on Kaweah between Rocky Hill and Palm, the crosswalk at Kaweah & Sequoia Dr. & the crosswalk at Kaweah & Chestnut.
In addition, the intersection at Kaweah & Palm is incredibly dangerous. For a period of time every morning & every afternoon it is impossible to turn north onto Kaweah from Palm, without a courteous driver allowing you out & incredibly difficult to turn west onto Palm from Kaweah. The other intersection that causes major issues AM/PM is the intersection of Firebaugh & Kaweah on the south end of town., signs, education, enforcement, instead of redirected down Ave. 204 then stop signs are needed at more intersections.

 As a bike rider who uses this intersection multiple times a week, this is the most dangerous spot for me, on my 25+ mile  route from home.
 When the traffic light changes to green, vehicles turning right check for oncoming traffic, but rarely look to the right to see if someone is in the crosswalk, or waiting on the sidewalk.
  Bright, blinking crossing lights in the pedestrian crossing, or a blinking sign would probably help.
 If the crossing sign is activated, maybe a 5 second delay for vehicles would provide pedestrians a head start and a safer crossing.

There are very few crosswalks on Broadway.  There is a park at the foot of truesdale, and the nearest convenience store is accross Broadway from truesdale.  Lots of people cross there.  There is a crosswalk on mccullens but that requires walking a long block from truesdale to mccullins then accross the 5 lanes and a block back, then the same route back is like walking 5 blocks just to cross the street.  No one is going to do that.  It seems to me that a crosswalk with a flashing yellow,000 to do but you asked for input, so there is my 2 cents worth.  For now I'll sprint between cars and takey chances.  I'm 61 and can still run, for now.  They go 40 mph there. It's all about timing!  Thank you, 3500 Broadway, Eureka, CA, 95503, USA,40.77547

4808, night, poor-sign, driving-speed, so the protected left-turn signal never activates. When in this position, you are facing a two-lane one-way flow of traffic, which feels dangerous. The only practical solution currently is to cross H street to the opposite sidewalk and use the crosswalk, which comes with its own risks. This issue seems significant as I frequently see a lot of people riding bikes on H Street., signs, or an accessible push-button for bike riders, which would activate the protected left-turn signal, could be helpful.
This location is also dangerous because it is next to the only inlet to the parking lot for the 4th St. liquor store on the south east corner, so people rush south through the intersection and immediately turn east into the lot. As a result, it can be scary to wait for the light to change when on a bike (even when in a car sometimes) when trying to turn left (North-to-West) at this intersection. I'm not sure what could make this safer other than re-designing the parking lot inlets and outlets there., Arcata, CA, 95521, USA,40.865053

Most accidents involve drivers heading west on Harris -inattentive drivers unaware the lane is ending or drivers turning left onto I St.
This intersection is near an ETS transit hub, county mental health, the boys & girls club, and many medical offices.. Depending on where one is walking to & from, detouring to the nearest safe pedestrian crossing can add anywhere from a few blocks to an extra kilometer.
I can not count how many near-misses I’ve seen as seniors without the physical ability to make that detour try to cross this intersection as they travel between the bus stop and the medical offices on Harris between I St and J St.
This intersection is terrifying to navigate as a cyclist. I St’s new class 2 bike lanes create more danger than is mitigated if they funnel bike traffic through such a dangerous intersection.

We believe it is a combination of aggressive driver behavior, distracted driving, and the vegetation at the NE intersection corner that completely blocks intersection sight distance., sidewalk, crosswalks, education, enforcement, other, the vegetation creates a vertical wall at the back of the sidewalk which reduces not only intersection sight distance, but also the effective width of the sidewalk which prevents 2 people from walking side-by-side comfortably.

11167, bike, transit, night, no-yield, driving-speed, other, fast, multi-lane arterial provides almost no bike facilities—and this is where the city is planning to build thousands of high density housing units. Bike,ped transit gaps and safety problems must be addressed. The Middlefield intersection is so bad for biking and walking, I actively avoid it, though I live nearby. Nita intersection is somewhat better and Charleston is somewhat better than Middlefield intersection, but could also be improved. Sharrows are completely inappropriate for this road. I am a confident and skilled bicyclist, and I avoid riding along and across San Antonio. It must be fixed for future residents (many of whom will be developmentally disabled or transitioning from being unhoused and may not own a car). Some may be children who need to walk and bike to schools. Please fix this awful bike/ped environment., signs, crosswalks, benches, education, I feel vulnerable. I have long, able legs, but I know the signal timing is insufficient for some people. Bike lanes disappear on Middlefield approaches to San Antonio, forcing people on bikes to take a lane. I’m not sure how children or the people who reside in the planned high density housing on San Antonio are supposed to get into town using foot-powered transportation for errands school and other activities., Palo Alto, CA, 94306, USA,37.416056

12664, ped, I slowed to turn R (north) on I St. A man in his 20s or 30s was trying to cross I st eastbound in the crosswalk on the north  side of harris, and I stopped to let him cross. His face had the distinctive features characteristic of people with Down's syndrome. He was moving very carefully and deliberately, and twice stepped back onto the NW corner because drivers driving East on harris turning north onto I didn't see or care that he was in the crosswalk. Another driver,  on I St trying to cross Harris Northbound, also didn't see or care that there was a pedestrian, and honked and shouted for me to, who had to jump back to the turn sign in the middle of the street to avoid harm.
WHY doesn't Harris and I have a light like Harris and H does?!?! It's so dangerous, and drivers struggle to safely navigate the change. It has heavy traffic and drivers often seem to feel pressured to make unsafe choices (eg shoot small gaps in traffic when making unprotected lefts,  or to zip around other cars at high speed) rather than hold up traffic and get honked at. Its near a public transportation hub and is the edge of a bike route, and so has lots of foot and bike traffic, but it is extremely dangerous to navigate outside of a car., Eureka, CA, 95503, USA,40.780418

12804, bike, poor-bikelane, other, kids at the school can't receive bus pick up, but the walking/bike route the must take puts them at risk because the must cross 5 lanes of traffic without protection. If they follow the route west to the crosswalk at Victor and Hartnell, they must travel east along Hartnell toward Yana, and there are no sidewalks from the corner of Victor and Hartnell to Yana.  A flashing crosswalk with a median would also be a safer option., bikelane, crosswalks, Redding, CA, 96002, USA,40.563767
12805, night, and there is a plain stop light (no left or right arrows).  Apparently because Costco generates a fair amount of traffic, and Broadway has two lanes in each direction, there are double right turn lanes for cars heading east on Wabash to turn south on Broadway.  To the left, there is a 'left turn only lane'.  The middle lane does have a 'go straight' arrow on the pavement along with a left arrow - but as a bicyclist wanting to stay on the bike lane, I've made the mistake of forgetting about the cars' right turn option and gotten between two cars turning left.  To avoid this situation, a cyclist must 'take' the middle lane.  A 'bicycle sharrow' in the middle lane does encourage that move.  I think the city should additionally have a sign:, Eureka, CA, 95501, USA,40.791568

Two of the cars stopped and got out to help me get my daughter out from under the 80 lb bike. She was traumatized. It would benefit bicyclists who commute from Mckinleyville to Arcata for motorists to have speed limit signs out there, as well as share the road signs, or bike signs painted on the road. Also, the hedge on that bend could be cut down to create a visible space. This is a major bike commuting route, yet there are large dump trucks and speeding cars on these country roads filled with drivers who don’t seem to be aware of bicyclists. I was wearing a bright neon yellow jacket and have a front headlight. Please help so that we can feel safe on the road as commuters.
